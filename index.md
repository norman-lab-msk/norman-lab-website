The Norman Lab aims to combine large-scale functional genomics experiments with computational modeling to enable rational engineering of cell state. Our primary model system is the fibroblast, a ubiquitous and phenotypically plastic cell type that plays a role in diverse pathologies. We played a foundational role in developing the Perturb-seq approach for single-cell CRISPR screening and continue to develop new approaches to enable functional genomics experiments beyond genome-scale. Our ultimate goal is to learn principles for precisely controlling cellular behavior, with potential applications in cell therapy and disease modeling.
