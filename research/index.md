CRISPR genetics and the explosion of experimental methods with single-cell resolution have each transformed our ability to study cell state and how it is perturbed in disease. A second revolution is now unfolding following the marriage of these two fields to produce single-cell CRISPR screens, in which many genetic perturbations (e.g. gene inhibition/activation by CRISPRi/a) are linked in pooled format to high-content measures of their effects (e.g. the transcriptome or morphology). These rich data can both identify genetic perturbations that elicit a particular behavior and catalog the spectrum of phenotypes associated with each genetic perturbation—i.e., one can perform “forward” and “reverse” genetics within the same experiment. The Norman Lab played a foundational role in the development of one of these techniques, Perturb-seq, and continues to develop new approaches to enable massive functional genomics experiments.
