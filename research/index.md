# Research

Single-cell CRISPR screens have emerged as a powerful tool for linking genetic perturbations (e.g. gene inhibition/activation by CRISPRi/a) to high-content measures of their phenotypic effects (e.g. the transcriptome or morphology). The Norman Lab played a foundational role in the development of one of these techniques, Perturb-seq, continues to develop new approaches that leverage it. Crucially, its transcriptome readout is both quantitative and interpretable, meaning it is possible to reason about progress towards realizing a desired phenotype using computational modeling. As it scales, we believe these features make Perturb-seq a promising tool for rationally engineering cellular transcriptional state.
